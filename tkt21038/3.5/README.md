
# DevOps with Docker
## Part 3 | Exercise 3.5

In exercises [1.12](https://devopswithdocker.com/part-1/section-6#exercises-111-114) and [1.13](https://devopswithdocker.com/part-1/section-6#exercises-111-114) we created Dockerfiles for both [frontend](https://github.com/docker-hy/material-applications/tree/main/example-frontend) and [backend](https://github.com/docker-hy/material-applications/tree/main/example-backend).

Security issues with the user being a root are serious for the example frontend and backend as the containers for web services are supposed to be accessible through the Internet.  
The backend image is based on [Alpine Linux](https://www.alpinelinux.org/), which does not support the command `useradd`. Google will surely help you a way to create a user in an `alpine` based image.

Make sure the containers start their processes as non-root user.  
Submit the Dockerfiles.

User accounts/groups for `alpine` based images:

Dockerfile: [backend](backend/Dockerfile)  
Dockerfile: [frontend](frontend/Dockerfile)

This exercise refers to Dockerfiles from 1.12 and 1.13 specifically, and none of the frontend app tests were implemented at that point.
