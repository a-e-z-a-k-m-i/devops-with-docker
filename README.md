This repository contains exercise solutions for the DevOps with Docker course from University of Helsinki. The course provides an introduction to container technologies that allow for a lightweight, portable way to package and deploy software applications, with a focus on Docker, container orchestration using Docker Compose, as well as container orchestration solutions such as K8s.

## Course Description

Throughout the course, learners will explore various components of web services, such as reverse proxies and databases, and learn how to deploy them using Docker. The course is divided into three parts:

### Part 01 | DevOps with Docker (TKT21036)

- Understand the fundamental concepts of Docker, including images and containers.
- Learn how to build Docker images for existing projects and run them.
- Explore how Docker can simplify the development process.

### Part 02 | DevOps with Docker: docker-compose (TKT21037)

- Manage complex multi-container applications with Docker Compose.
- Understand the role of Docker Compose in container orchestration.
- Practice deploying and managing real-world applications using Docker Compose.

### Part 03 | DevOps with Docker: security and optimization (TKT21038)

- Learn how to optimize Docker images for production, including reducing image size and improving security.
- Understand the limitations of using Docker Compose in production environments, as well as the need for more advanced orchestration tools.
- Explore alternative container orchestration solutions, primarily Kubernetes.
